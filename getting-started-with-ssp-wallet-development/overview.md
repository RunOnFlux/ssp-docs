# Overview

SSP Wallet is not just another crypto wallet. It is a **true two-factor authentication wallet** designed with **security** and **self-custody** at its core. Here's how it works:

1. **Two Devices, Two Keys:**
   * Your **SSP Wallet** contains one private key.
   * Your **SSP Key** (on your mobile device) contains a second private key.
2. **2-of-2 Multisignature:**
   * Transactions are constructed and signed by the SSP Wallet and then signed again by SSP Key.
3. **Enhanced Security:**
   * Keys, seeds, and sensitive data are never shared between devices, making it impossible to compromise without access to both devices.

This design ensures that **both devices are required** to authorize any transaction, making the wallet incredibly secure and user-friendly.
