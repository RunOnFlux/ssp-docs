```

- ✍️ **Write it Down**: Keep a secure backup copy
- 🚫 **Never Share**: Your password should be known only to you

### Step 4: Review Terms and Disclaimer

**Important Legal Information:**

Before creating your wallet, carefully review the SSP Wallet Disclaimer:

📋 **[Read Full Disclaimer](https://github.com/RunOnFlux/ssp-wallet/blob/master/DISCLAIMER.md)**

**Key Points:**
- SSP Wallet is **self-custody** - you control your funds

- **No customer support** can recover lost seed phrases
- **Use at your own risk** for cryptocurrency operations

✅ **Check "I agree with SSP Wallet Disclaimer"** only after reading and understanding the terms.

**Click "Create Wallet"** to proceed to seed phrase generation.

### Step 5: Backup Your Seed Phrase (CRITICAL)

🚨 **MOST IMPORTANT STEP** 🚨

Your seed phrase is the **master key** to your wallet. This 12-word phrase can restore your wallet if you lose access to this device.

**⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS:**
- 🔑 **Seed phrase = Complete wallet control**
- 💸 **Lost seed phrase = Lost funds PERMANENTLY**  
- 📱 **No customer support can recover lost seed phrases**
- 🚫 **Never store digitally** (no photos, no cloud, no digital notes)
- ✏️ **Only write on physical paper**

**Proper Seed Phrase Backup Process:**

1. **Prepare Materials**: Get pen and paper (not pencil)
2. **Ensure Privacy**: Make sure no one can see your screen
3. **Click "Show Mnemonic Wallet Seed Phrase"**
4. **Write Down All 12 Words** in exact order
5. **Double-Check Spelling** - every letter matters
6. **Store Securely** in a safe location

**Seed Phrase Storage Best Practices:**

✅ **DO:**
- Write on waterproof/fireproof paper
- Store in a safety deposit box
- Make multiple copies in different locations
- Keep away from digital devices
- Tell trusted family member the location (not the words)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Take photos or screenshots
- Store in cloud services (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)
- Email to yourself
- Store in password managers  
- Share with anyone
- Store all copies in same location

**After writing down your seed phrase:**

✅ **Check "I have backed up my wallet seed phrase in a secure location"**

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (214).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

**Click "Confirm"** to proceed to seed phrase verification.

### Step 6: Verify Your Seed Phrase Backup

To ensure you've backed up your seed phrase correctly, you'll need to confirm specific words.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2025-01-08 17-20-14.png" alt="" width="312"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

**Verification Process:**
1. **System will ask for specific words** (e.g., "What is the 3rd word?")
2. **Type the exact word** from your backup
3. **Spelling must be perfect** - check your written backup
4. **Complete all verification prompts**

⚠️ **If verification fails:**
- Go back and re-copy your seed phrase
- Double-check spelling and word order
- Ensure you have all 12 words written correctly

### Step 7: Complete Wallet Creation

After successful seed phrase verification:
