### Why SSP Wallet?

SSP Wallet is not just another crypto wallet. It is a **true two-factor authentication wallet** designed with **security** and **self-custody** at its core. Here's how it works:

1. **Two Devices, Two Keys:**
   * Your **SSP Wallet** contains one private key.
   * Your **SSP Key** (on your mobile device) contains a second private key.
2. **2-of-2 Multisignature:**
   * Transactions are constructed and signed by the SSP Wallet and then signed again by SSP Key.
3. **Enhanced Security:**
   * Keys, seeds, and sensitive data are never shared between devices, making it impossible to compromise without access to both devices.

This design ensures that **both devices are required** to authorize any transaction, making the wallet incredibly secure and user-friendly.

***

### Technical Details

#### Key Derivation

* SSP Wallet adheres to the **BIP48 derivation scheme** for generating hierarchical deterministic keys supporting P2SH, P2SH-P2WSH, and P2WSH addresses.
* Example derivation paths for popular chains:
  * **Bitcoin:** `m/48'/0'/0'/2'/0/0`
  * **Flux:** `m/48'/19167'/0'/0'/0/0`
* Extended functionality includes support for additional chains and constructing multiple external addresses per chain as needed.

#### Synchronization Process

**Initial Setup:**

1. **SSP Relay Server:**
   * Simplifies the synchronization process by facilitating communication between SSP Wallet and SSP Key.
   * Synchronization starts when the SSP Key scans a Hardened Extended Public Key QR code from SSP Wallet.
   * A special identity path (`m/48'/0'/0'/2'/10/0`) reserved for SSP Wallet verifies unique wallet instances.
   * [SSP Relay GitHub Repository](https://github.com/RunOnFlux/ssp-relay)
2. **Public Key Exchange:**
   * SSP Key sends its hardened extended public key (e.g., `m/48'/0'/0'/2'`) to the SSP Relay Server along with a constructed 2-of-2 multisignature address.
   * SSP Wallet validates the received address, ensuring integrity.
3. **Validation and Confirmation:**
   * Both SSP Wallet and SSP Key confirm matching derived addresses to finalize synchronization.

**Transaction Signing:**

* Transactions are signed in two steps:
  1. SSP Wallet constructs the transaction and signs it with its private key.
  2. SSP Key receives the partially signed transaction via the relay server, signs it with its private key, and returns the fully signed transaction for broadcast.

**Offline Functionality:**

* Transactions and synchronization can bypass the relay server through manual QR code scanning, maintaining security in environments with restricted connectivity.

#### Encryption and Storage Security

**Sensitive Data:**

1. **Encryption Layers:**
   * PBKDF2-based password derivation generates keys for AES-GCM encryption.
   * Secondary encryption uses device and browser fingerprints to restrict data access to the originating environment.
2. **Local Data Management:**
   * Serialized sensitive data (e.g., keys, seeds) is stored as JSON blobs with base64-encoded fields (`data`, `iv`, and `salt`).
   * This approach prevents brute-force attacks and unauthorized migration between devices.

**Session Management:**

* Encrypted passwords are stored temporarily in session storage, ensuring convenience without compromising security.
* No sensitive data is ever retained in unencrypted form, even within the applicationâ€™s runtime memory.

**Non-Sensitive Data:**

* Information such as transaction history and balance data is stored using **LocalForge**, prioritizing performance without compromising sensitive details.

#### Attack Mitigation Strategies

* **Anti-Phishing Measures:**
  * The wallet and key validate each other's public keys and derived addresses during setup.
* **Server Security:**
  * SSP Relay Server only facilitates communication and cannot access private keys or sensitive data.
* **Brute Force Protection:**
  * Physical possession of both devices and knowledge of passwords are required to compromise the wallet.

### WalletConnect Integration

SSP Wallet supports **WalletConnect v2** (now **Reown**), enabling seamless integration with thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) on EVM-compatible networks.

#### Key Features:
* **EVM dApp Compatibility:** Connect to any WalletConnect-enabled dApp on Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, and Base
* **DeFi & NFT Support:** Full integration with DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and trading platforms
* **Account Abstraction Support:** Native ERC-4337 Account Abstraction on supported EVM chains
* **EIP-712 Message Signing:** Full support for typed structured data signing standard used by modern dApps
* **Secure Transaction Signing:** All transactions still require both SSP Wallet and SSP Key for authorization
* **Real-Time Communication:** Instant connection and transaction requests through secure WebSocket connections

**Note:** WalletConnect is available only for EVM-compatible networks (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Base). UTXO networks (Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc.) use native wallet functionality.
